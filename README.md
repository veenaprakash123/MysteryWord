** MYSTERY WORD **


Mystery Word is a two player game where two players will try to guess a word selected by the other user. For each round, one player will select a word, and the other player will guess the letters that are included in that word. For every incorrect guess, a piece of a holiday themed drawing will be displayed. If the whole image is displayed the Player making the guesses loses that round, and the other player earns a point. If they correctly guess all the letters in the word, they win the round! For the following round, the players will switch places - the one who guessed in the first round, will select the word for the second round. The player who selected the word in the first round will guess letters belonging to the new word. The first player to win two rounds wins the overall game!
